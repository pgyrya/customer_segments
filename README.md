This is an unsupervised Machine Learning project, part of Udacity nanodegree program, practicing: 

* outlier detection, 
* correlation analysis, 
* data visualization, 
* principal component analysis(PCA), 
* clustering (Gaussian Mixture Model)

The objective is to uncover hidden patterns in customer spending behavior and discover distribution this data may be sampled from.
